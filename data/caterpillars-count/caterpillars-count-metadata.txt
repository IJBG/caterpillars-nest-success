The columns in the included spreadsheet are as follows:

SiteName: Name of the Caterpillars Count! site
SiteDescription: Description of the Caterpillars Count! site
Latitude: Latitude of the Caterpillars Count! site
Longitude: Longitude of the Caterpillars Count! site
Region: State or Province of the Caterpillars Count! site
LocalDate: Date of the observation
LocalTime: Time of the observation
SurveyLocationCode: Unique 3-letter code specifying a particular survey branch
Circle: Circle number of the survey branch
Orientation: A-E, identifying one of the 5 survey branches within the specified circle
PlantSpeciesMarkedByObserver: Plant species of the survey branch as entered by the local site coordinator
OfficialPlantSpecies: Standardized plant species name as specified by a site administrator
PlantIsConiferous: Is the plant a conifer; 0 = no, 1 = yes
ObservationMethod: Survey method, either "Visual" or "Beat Sheet"
SurveyNotes: Any notes applicable to the survey branch as a whole
WetLeavesOrNeedles: Were the leaves (or, if the plant is coniferous, needles) wet at the time of the survey; 0 = no, 1 = yes
NumberOfLeaves: For coniferous plants, -1. For non-coniferous plants, number of leaves examined on the survey branch; for Visual surveys this is 50, but it may be variable for Beat Sheet surveys
AverageLeafLength: For coniferous plants, -1. For non-coniferous plants, average length of the leaf (or leaflet) blade not counting the petiole, in cm
HerbivoryScore: For coniferous plants, -1. For non-coniferous plants, categorical herbivory score for the set of leaves examined; 0 = None, 1 = Trace (<5%), 2 = Light (5-10%), 3 = Moderate (10-25%), 4 = Heavy (>25%)
AverageNeedleLength: For coniferous plants, average length of the needle, in cm. For non-coniferous plants, -1
LinearBranchLength: For coniferous plants, a rough sum of the branch lengths observed, in cm. For non-coniferous plants, -1
OriginalArthropodGroup: Originally reported arthropod group
UpdatedArthropodGroup: Arthropod group that includes any corrected id's based on iNaturalist user feedback
ArthropodLength: Length of the observed arthropod from the tip of the head to the tip of the abdomen, in mm (doesn't include antennae or legs)
ArthropodQuantity: Number of arthropods of a given group and length observed
ArthropodPhotoURL: For observations with photos, a link to the observation on iNaturalist
ArthropodNotes: Any notes applicable to the arthropod observed
IsCaterpillarAndIsHairy: If the observed arthropod is a caterpillar that is significantly hairy or spiny, 1, otherwise 0
IsCaterpillarAndIsInLeafRoll: If the observed arthropod is a caterpillar that is inside a rolled or folded leaf, 1, otherwise 0
IsCaterpillarAndIsInSilkTent: If the observed arthropod is a caterpillar that is inside a silk tent, 1, otherwise 0
IsButterflyOrMothAndIsPupa: If the observed arthropod is a butterfly or moth and is in the pupa stage, 1, otherwise 0
OriginalIsBeetleLarva: If the observed arthropod is a beetle larva, 1, otherwise 0 (as specified by the original observer)
UpdatedIsBeetleLarva: If the observed arthropod is a beetle larva, 1, otherwise 0 (includes any corrected id's based on iNaturalist user feedback)
OriginalIsSawflyLarva: If the observed arthropod is a sawfly larva, 1, otherwise 0 (as specified by the original observer)
UpdatedIsSawflyLarva: If the observed arthropod is a sawfly larva, 1, otherwise 0 (includes any corrected id's based on iNaturalist user feedback)
